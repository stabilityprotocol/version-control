## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-08

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Release

#### Added

- **Core Blockchain Integration**

  - Git post-commit hook for automatic blockchain submission
  - Stability ZKT (Zero-Knowledge Transactions) API integration
  - Smart contract deployment and interaction
  - SHA-256 hashing of entire codebase for integrity verification

- **Smart Contract Features**

  - `CommitRegistry.sol` smart contract for structured data storage
  - Functions: `storeCommit`, `getCommit`, `commitExists`, `getTotalCommits`
  - Event emission for commit storage with indexed fields
  - Support for commit metadata: hash, author, email, branch, message, project

- **Network Support**

  - Stability mainnet integration (`https://rpc.stabilityprotocol.com/zkt`)
  - Testnet support for development (`https://rpc.testnet.stabilityprotocol.com/zkt`)
  - Public endpoint (rate-limited) and private endpoint (API key) options
  - Zero gas fees through Stability's gasless architecture

- **Installation & Setup Tools**

  - `install-hook.sh` - Automated Git hook installation
  - `deploy-contract.sh` - Smart contract deployment automation
  - `quick-test.sh` - Rapid testing and verification
  - `demo-complete.sh` - Full demonstration workflow
  - `uninstall-hook.sh` - Clean removal of hooks and configuration

- **Configuration Management**

  - `stability-config.sh` - Centralized configuration file
  - Support for API endpoints, contract addresses, project settings
  - Network selection (mainnet/testnet)
  - Optional API key configuration for private endpoints

- **Documentation**

  - Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
  - API reference documentation (`docs/api-reference.md`)
  - ZKT integration guide (`docs/zkt-integration.md`)
  - Troubleshooting guides and examples

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  - Windows support (Git Bash, PowerShell compatibility)
  - macOS and Linux support
  - Robust path handling and command detection
  - Fallback mechanisms for missing tools

#### Technical Implementation

- **Blockchain Submission Flow**

  - Post-commit hook triggers automatically after Git commits
  - Extracts commit metadata (hash, author, message, timestamp, branch)
  - Generates SHA-256 hash of entire repository state
  - Constructs ZKT payload for smart contract interaction
  - Submits to Stability blockchain via HTTP POST
  - Logs transaction results and handles errors gracefully

- **Security Features**

  - Only metadata stored on blockchain (no source code)
  - SHA-256 cryptographic integrity verification
  - Immutable blockchain records for audit trails
  - Secure API key handling (optional private endpoints)

- **Error Handling**
  - Graceful degradation on network failures
  - Comprehensive logging to `logs/stability-hook.log`
  - Non-blocking Git workflow (commits succeed even if blockchain fails)
  - Detailed error messages and troubleshooting information

#### Dependencies

- Git (any recent version)
- curl (for HTTP requests)
- bash shell (Git Bash on Windows)
- SHA-256 utilities (`sha256sum`, `shasum`, or `gsha256sum`)

### Known Issues

- Windows PowerShell requires Git Bash for optimal compatibility
- Some `sed` commands may need fallbacks on certain Windows configurations
- Contract deployment requires valid network connectivity

### Deployment Information

- **Smart Contract Address (Mainnet)**: `0x8dda20DC43e4e3379d771adF8808C83959a246d2`
- **Network**: Stability Protocol Mainnet
- **Gas Fees**: Zero (gasless through ZKT)
- **Storage**: On-chain smart contract with structured data

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features

- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon)
- Web dashboard for commit visualization
- Team collaboration features
- Git LFS integration for large files
- IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Advanced verification and audit tools

### Version Tags

- `v1.0.0` - Initial stable release with full blockchain integration
- `v0.9.0` - Beta release with smart contract deployment
- `v0.8.0` - Alpha release with ZKT integration
- `v0.7.0` - Initial proof of concept

### Migration Guide

#### From v0.x to v1.0.0

1. Update configuration file format (new `stability-config.sh` structure)
2. Redeploy smart contracts (new `CommitRegistry.sol` with enhanced features)
3. Reinstall Git hooks (updated post-commit hook with improved error handling)
4. Update API endpoints (switch to production ZKT URLs)
